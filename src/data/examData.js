  "overview": "The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is a standardized examination designed to assess key skills necessary for success in law school. For students interested in 5-year integrated law programs, the LSAT-India serves as a gateway to some of the most prestigious law institutions in the country.The LSAT evaluates critical reading, analytical reasoning, logical reasoning, and persuasive writing skills – all essential competencies for prospective law students. Unlike many other entrance exams, the LSAT doesn't test specific subject knowledge but rather focuses on skills that predict success in legal education.The 5-year integrated law programs in India (BA LLB, BBA LLB, BSc LLB) allow students to pursue law studies directly after completing their 12th standard education, making it an attractive option for those who have early clarity about their legal career aspirations.",
